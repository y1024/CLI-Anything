## Overview

`cli-anything-wiremock` is a command-line interface that wraps the WireMock Admin REST API (`/__admin/`). It allows agents and developers to manage HTTP stub mappings, inspect served requests, control stateful scenarios, and record real backend traffic — all from the terminal or from agent tool calls.

WireMock is commonly used in integration testing environments to replace real HTTP backends with controllable mock responses.

## Command Groups

| `reset`    | Full reset: stubs + requests + scenarios         |
| `shutdown` | Gracefully shut down the WireMock server         |

## Key Examples

```bash
# Check connectivity
cli-anything-wiremock status

# Create a stub using quick form
cli-anything-wiremock stub quick GET /api/users 200 --body '[{"id":1}]'

# Create a stub using full JSON
cli-anything-wiremock stub create '{
  "request": {"method": "POST", "url": "/api/orders"},
  "response": {"status": 201, "body": "{\"id\":99}"}
}'

# Verify a POST was made exactly once
cli-anything-wiremock --json request count '{"method":"POST","url":"/api/orders"}'
# → {"count": 1}

# Scenario: advance state
cli-anything-wiremock scenario set "cart-flow" "item-added"

# Record a real backend
cli-anything-wiremock record start https://api.example.com
# ... make requests ...
cli-anything-wiremock record stop
```

## Agent Guidance

### Always use `--json` in agent contexts

Use `--json` for all invocations in scripts or agent tool calls. JSON output varies by command type (these are distinct response types, not an envelope wrapping all responses):

```bash
# Data commands return raw WireMock API JSON directly:
cli-anything-wiremock --json stub quick GET /api/hello 200 --body '{"hello":"world"}'
# → {"id": "abc-123", "request": {...}, "response": {...}, ...}

cli-anything-wiremock --json stub list
# → {"mappings": [...], "total": N}

# Void commands (delete, reset, save) return:
# → {"status": "ok"}

# Errors return:
# → {"status": "error", "message": "Connection refused"}
```

### Connection via environment

Set connection params via environment variables before calling any command:

```bash
export WIREMOCK_HOST=localhost
export WIREMOCK_PORT=8080
```

### Workflow pattern for test verification

1. Set up stubs before running the system under test:
   ```bash
   cli-anything-wiremock --json stub quick POST /api/payment 200 --body '{"success":true}'
   ```
2. Run the system under test.
3. Verify interactions:
   ```bash
   cli-anything-wiremock --json request count '{"method":"POST","url":"/api/payment"}'
   ```
4. Clean up:
   ```bash
   cli-anything-wiremock reset
   ```

### Error handling

Non-zero exit code on all errors. In `--json` mode, errors return `{"status": "error", "message": "..."}`. Success returns the raw WireMock API response.
